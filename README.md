# LoAsEasyAlgorithmicChallenge

Woebot company coding challenge. Via [this git repo](https://gist.github.com/dmoreh/ba524ec60c99920d5c7e6adf9cdf8dee/)

Summary:

>Say you have a list of a random hashable type (the same type throughout), in an arbitrary order.
>How do you find the most common item in the list (along with its count) after the first instance of a given item?
>
>Examples:
>[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1], 2 -> (4, 2)
>[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1], 1 -> (1, 3)
>["red", "green", "blue", "green", "blue"], "green" -> ("blue", 2)


The presented solution not only solves a problem, but represents the usage of a Swift language specific approach.
